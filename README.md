# detect-ai-generated-essay

This project implements a simple Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. The goal is to predict whether an essay is generated by a Language Model (LLM) or by a human.


Usage
1) Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:
**pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk**

2) Additionally, download the NLTK stopwords if you haven't already:

python -m nltk.downloader stopwords

3) Run the Classifier:

python naive_bayes_classifier.py

The script will load the dataset, split it into training and development sets, build a vocabulary, calculate probabilities with Laplace smoothing, and finally, classify essays on the development set.

The code also will provide the top 10 words which classify each of the two classes.
Finally, the last code classify_test will run on the provided test file and submit the probability for each row. The probability is the indication of if the essay was generated by AI.(LLM)

**Dependencies**
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk

**Project Structure**
naive_bayes_classifier.py: The main Python script implementing the Naive Bayes classifier.
input/train_essays.csv: The input dataset containing essays. (need to change according to the location)
